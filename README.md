Building a web page like Google Keep

This repository is the first project for the Front-end development workshop held by Made in Lobby 2021.
The concepts covered were javascript, HTML, and CSS. I was an attendee in this workshop.
This project has the aim of making a webpage like "Google Keep."
To do so, first adding notes were distinguished using javascript, then some stylings were added like the ones in google keep itself. 
Here are some pictures of how this webpage would look like in different devices having different sizes.

First, let's have a look ar Google Keep itsef:
